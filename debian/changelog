open-friendly-net-detection-client (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * BREAKING: Replace one-shot query UNIX socket with persistent streaming

    (one line per change) without reconnecting.
  * Added subscriber broadcast mechanism and connection lifecycle handling.
  * Version bump to 0.2.0 to reflect protocol behavior change.
  * Fix dhclient exit hook install path (was placed in subdirectory and not executed).
    Now installed directly as /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/50-fnd-client.
